## fac-fruit-shop
A fruit shop that lets users pick a fruit basket. The user can add and remove items from the basket and see the contents of their basket.

The goal of the project was to create a fruit shop that:

* Displays fruits available for purchase.
* Has a working add to basket button for each fruit.
* Stores the user’s basket as a JavaScript object.
* Has buttons to add one, remove one, and remove all instances of a fruit in the basket.
* Increments or decrements the object values when fruits are added or removed.
* Uses reusable functions to complete repeated tasks.
* Displays the quantity of each fruit in the basket, when there is at least one of any fruit.
* Displays the basket as empty if all object values are zero.
* Shows a total number of fruits in the basket.
